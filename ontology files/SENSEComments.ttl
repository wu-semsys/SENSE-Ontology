sense:EventToStateConversion rdfs:comment "A Procedure that is used to convert an event or set of events to a state or set of states." .


sense:EventType rdfs:comment "A type of event. Each event has an event type." .

sense:State rdfs:comment "A state of a sensor. A state is a condition of a sensor over a period of time. A state is started and ended by an event." .


sense:StateType rdfs:comment "A type of a state. Each state has a state type." .


sense:StateTypeCausality rdfs:comment "A type causality relation between two state types." .

sense:causallyRelated rdfs:comment "A causal relation between two state instances." .


sense:cause rdfs:comment "Relation between a state type causality and the state type that is the cause of the relation." .


sense:causes rdfs:comment "A type of causal relation. If eventA occurs, eventB most probably occurs as a result." .


sense:effect rdfs:comment "Relation between a state type causality and the state type that is the effect of the relation." .

sense:hasStartEventType rdfs:comment "Relation between a state type and an event type. Describes which event type starts a certain state type." .


sense:hasStateType rdfs:comment "relation between a state and its state type." .


sense:hasTemporalRelation rdfs:comment "relation between a state type causality and the temporal restrictions of the relation." .


sense:hasTopologicalRelation rdfs:comment "relation between a state type causality and the topological restrictions of the relation." .


sense:prevents rdfs:comment "A type of causal relation. If eventA occurs, eventB most probably does not occur as a result." .


sense:temporalRelation rdfs:comment "A type of temporal relation, which can be one of four options: before, overlaps, contains, identity" .


sense:timeSeriesDataRef rdfs:comment "reference to the time series data that is needed for the procedure." .
