s:Event rdfs:comment "something happening in the system, which is of interest. An event is always considered to be happening at a single time point." .
s:EventDetection rdfs:comment "A procedure to detect an event in the system." .
s:EventToStateConversion rdfs:comment "A Procedure that is used to convert an event or set of events to a state or set of states." .
s:EventType rdfs:comment "A type of event. Each event has an event type." .
s:SensorType rdfs:comment "A type of a sensor. Each sensor as a sensor type." .
s:State rdfs:comment "A state of a sensor. A state is a condition of a sensor over a period of time. A state is started and ended by an event." .
s:StateType rdfs:comment  "A type of a state. Each state has a state type." .
s:StateTypeCausality rdfs:comment "A type causality relation between two state types." .
s:algorithm rdfs:comment "A reference to an algorithm, which implements a procedure" .
s:associatedSensorType rdfs:comment "relation between a state type and the sensor type, where such a state type can occur." .
s:causalRelation rdfs:comment "A type of causal relation, which can be one of three options: causes, prevents, enables" .
s:causallyRelated rdfs:comment "A causal relation between two state instances." .
s:cause rdfs:comment "Relation between a state type causality and the state type that is the cause of the relation." .
s:causes rdfs:comment "A type of causal relation. If eventA occurs, eventB most probably occurs as a result." .
s:effect rdfs:comment "Relation between a state type causality and the state type that is the effect of the relation." .
s:enables rdfs:comment "A type of causal relation. If eventA does not occur, eventB most probably does not occur (not enabled to occur)" .
s:hasCausalRelation rdfs:comment "relation between a state type causality and the type of causality described." .
s:hasEndEvent rdfs:comment "relation between a state and the event that is ending the state." .
s:hasEndEventType rdfs:comment "Relation between a state type and an event type. Describes which event type ends a certain state type." .
s:hasEventType rdfs:comment "relation between an event and its event type." .
s:hasSensorType rdfs:comment "relation between a sensor and its sensor type." .
s:hasStartEvent rdfs:comment "relation between a state and the event that is starting the state." .
s:hasStartEventType rdfs:comment "Relation between a state type and an event type. Describes which event type starts a certain state type." .
s:hasStateType rdfs:comment "relation between a state and its state type." .
s:hasTemporalRelation rdfs:comment "relation between a state type causality and the temporal restrictions of the relation." .
s:hasTopologicalRelation rdfs:comment "relation between a state type causality and the topological restrictions of the relation." .
s:prevents rdfs:comment "A type of causal relation. If eventA occurs, eventB most probably does not occur as a result." .
s:temporalRelation rdfs:comment "A type of temporal relation, which can be one of four options: before, overlaps, contains, identity" .
s:timeSeriesDataRef rdfs:comment "reference to the time series data that is needed for the procedure." .
s:topologicalRelation rdfs:comment "A type of topological relation, which can be one of three options: samePlatform, siblingPlatform, parentPlatform" .
